		<p>As with some websites it is common to see a page dedicated to just
		stating what partners, associates and/or other organisation/companies they 
		are connected with. This can be useful for newer uses, as seeing that your website is partnered 
		with perhaps other organisation/companies they recognise, could see them take an instant liking towards
		both the organisation/companies you are with and perhaps even the website. Below is some nonsense for filler text.<br><br>
